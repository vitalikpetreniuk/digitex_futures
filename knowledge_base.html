								<h3>Announcement</h3>
								<h4>Digitex Futures Exchange Launch Date!</h4>
								<p>Digitex Ltd announced on 23rd August that its development team SmartDec has confirmed a launch date for the public testnet. The world’s first zero-fee cryptocurrency futures trading platform will be available to the public for testing on 30th November, 2019.</p>
								<p>The initial launch will be on a public testnet, offering access to trading in one market to begin with--a BTC/USD perpetual swap contract. The public testnet version will support at least 10,000 concurrent users, who will engage in virtual trades of BTC/USD futures with speeds of up to 50,000 transactions per second. </p>
								<p>After a period of rigorous testing and third-party auditing anticipated to last at least two months, the platform will be ready for a full public launch with live trading and additional features and markets. To read the full announcement,

								<h3>Digitex Futures Exchange Overview</h3>
								<h4>The Digitex Futures Exchange: Zero-Fee, Peer to Peer Crypto Futures Trading Platform</h4>
								<p>Digitex Futures is a zero-fee, peer-to-peer crypto futures exchange with its own base currency, the DGTX token. Digitex is using Ethereum’s blockchain technology to build a cutting-edge crypto futures exchange with zero trading fees.</p>
								<p>From the point of launch of the public testnet, we will offer a BTC/USD perpetual swap futures contract. However, we will be adding more markets as we develop our platform.</p>
								<h4>Key Differentiators of the Digitex Exchange:</h4>
								<p>Digitex’s automated market makers are programmed to lose over time. This churns more liquidity through the exchange, and gives traders the additional incentive to compete for their losses. It will also create highly active markets with tight bid/ask spreads.</p>
								<p>The Digitex exchange model is revolutionary within the cryptocurrency and futures trading space. Traders win and lose in Digitex (DGTX) tokens. Traders must have a balance of DGTX cryptocurrency to place trades, thus creating a demand for the DGTX token.</p>
								<p>This demand is what enables us to charge zero transaction fees on all trades. Zero-fee trading attracts extremely active, ultra-short term traders who create highly liquid markets using strategies not viable on fee-charging exchanges and existing futures trading websites. Large tick sizes level the playing field between human traders and bots.</p>
								<p>After our initial public testnet launch in November 2019, we will be working on developing the platform to offer non-custodial account balances to our users. This will put Digitex in the position of being another world-first--a hybrid exchange with a centralized, sophisticated order book and the security of decentralized account balances held on a smart contract.</p>
								<h4>Zero-Fee Futures Trading </h4>
								<p>Digitex Futures is the world’s first zero-fee cryptocurrency futures trading platform. Other exchanges in the crypto futures markets such as BitMEX, Deribit, and OKEx charge traders based on a maker and taker fee model.</p>
								<p>Digitex CEO Adam Todd made his career on the back of a style of trading known as scalping. Scalping is an extremely short-term, high-frequency trading style that aims to take small, most often single-tick profits from each trade. Scalp traders often exit a position within minutes if they don’t see an immediate profit.</p>
								<p>The scalping style of trading described here is the easiest to learn, requires no specialized knowledge about the underlying instrument and will give you steadier, less volatile results. However, it requires a lot of discipline and this style of trading is particularly susceptible to the ravages of the maker and taker fee model of crypto futures exchanges.</p>
								<p>Let’s illustrate this with an example. In the traditional German Bund futures markets where Adam started his career, scalpers could successfully trade in this manner because the value of one tick on the Bund was 25 Deutsch Marks and the commission to buy and sell one futures contract was less than 3 Deutsch Marks. Traders would get a scratch trade rebate every time they bought and sold at the same price.</p>
								<p>Traders only had to make one tick for every 10 round turns to break even, and anything over that was profit. It was a lot harder than it sounds. But it was possible because the commission fee to buy and sell one futures contract was one-tenth of the value of one tick.</p>
								<p>Currently, this style of short term scalping to win is literally impossible. The commission cost of buying and selling one futures contract with a taker order is more like 10 times the value of one tick. There’s a built-in mechanical edge that you cannot beat, and which guarantees you will lose over the long run.</p>
								<p>In the current BitMEX fee model, the taker fee is 0.075% of the notional value of the underlying instrument. That may look small, but if you’re trading with 100x leverage that’s actually 7.5% of the margin you put down to enter the trade. If you exit the trade with a Taker order, your trading fees are 15% of the order value!</p>
								<p>For example, total fees on a $1,000 trade with 100x leverage are $150 [100 x $1,000 x 0.00075 x 2]. How can you ever expect to beat a 15% edge working against you?</p>
								<p>At Digitex, our exchange derives its value from the DGTX token, not from charging fees to our traders who are providing liquidity to the exchange. This zero-commission fee model is what attracts traders to our exchange. Demand for the opportunity of zero-fee, profitable trading will drive the value of the DGTX token as the only means of accessing our platform.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-id="cb3" class="cb-item">
								<h3>Futures Trading</h3>
								<h4>Getting Started Trading Futures</h4>
								<p>On the Digitex exchange, you can buy futures using DGTX only. This means that you’ll need to buy ether, first of all, to purchase DGTX and then all your profits and losses will be denominated in DGTX.</p>
								<p>You will be buying a perpetual swap contract, which will be a dollar’s worth of DGTX tokens and has no expiration date. Read about our contract specifications further on in our Knowledge Base. They are essentially the same as other major futures exchanges such as BitMEX and Bybit. This is intentional, to make it easier for their traders to switch over to Digitex. We want to make it as simple as possible to create winning traders and to allow them to trade successfully.</p>
								<p>Skilled traders are used to trading futures for profit. It takes time and discipline, but even if you’re just starting out, earning some extra income from day trading futures is certainly within your reach, especially on a platform that charges no commissions and has no mechanical edge working against you.</p>
								<h4>How to Become a Winning Trader</h4>
								<p>At Digitex Futures, we firmly believe that traders are made and not born. Anyone can become a winning trader with the right level of discipline, attitude, practice, and commitment. Digitex CEO Adam Todd is a living example of this. With no formal college education, Adam carved out a career as a successful futures trader in the open outcry trading pit in London.</p>
								<p>There are many <b>different trading strategies</b> and choosing one depends on various factors, from how much time you have to dedicate to trading, to how quickly you want to see a profit, and how much loss you’re prepared to absorb. On the Digitex platform, all types of traders are welcome. However, zero commissions on all trades will be particularly attractive to high-frequency short-term traders, otherwise known as scalpers.</p>
								<p>The scalping strategy can create many winning traders in the right conditions. Rather than chase the profits, scalpers will look to minimize their risk and avoid as many losses as possible. This is why they hold their positions for a very short time (sometimes even seconds) as the longer you hold a position, the greater your exposure to risk.</p>
								<p>Adam’s scalping strategy involves judging when the momentum is high enough to keep the move going for another 30 seconds. If he doesn’t get at least a single tick profit within that time frame, he will exit that trade.</p>
								<p>If you’re new to cryptocurrency, the good news is that short-term scalping requires no fundamental knowledge of the underlying instrument on which you’re trading. You simply look to buy and sell with a one or two tick profit or even a scratch, avoiding any losses and with zero emotions attached to the trade. </p>
								<p>This style of ultra short term, manual trading is labor-intensive and requires full concentration and attention. You can’t be checking emails and looking on Facebook or reading random crypto trading articles while <b>you’re scalping to win</b>.</p>
								<p>This scalping style of trading is the easiest to learn and will give you steadier, less volatile results. However, scalping like this is particularly susceptible to the unforgiving maker and taker fee model of all other crypto futures exchanges.</p>
								<p>The taker fee model used has established commissions that are astronomically high and scalping to win is rendered impossible. The commission cost of buying and selling one futures contract with a taker order is more like 10 times the value of one tick.</p>
								<p>A typical trade for a short term scalper involves entering a trade quickly, then immediately placing a maker order to join the bid or offer to get out. If it’s not filled within seconds, the scalper will cancel it and lift the offer or hit the bid with another taker order to exit the trade.</p>
								<p>Large commissions make it impossible for profitable short-term scalping currently which greatly damages liquidity as active traders are the lifeblood of an exchange. The Digitex Futures exchange will be a short-term trader’s paradise. With no trading fees of any kind on taker orders, traders will be free to pursue strategies that are not viable anywhere else, creating massive liquidity in the process and more and more winning traders over time.</p>
								<h4>Beginners Guide To Trading Futures</h4>
								<p>Trading futures successfully is about avoiding mistakes and minimizing your risk. You must learn to manage your emotions if you want to be a successful futures trader. If you don’t manage your emotions effectively, you run the risk that they’ll eventually get the better of you.</p>
								<p>It’s natural to feel fear if you hear bad news about the markets or think it’s worth hanging onto a position to wring a few more dollars out of it. But basing trading decisions on these feelings is a sure-fire route to losing money. To successfully day trade futures online, stick to your plan, and leave the emotions out of it.</p>
								<p>Moreover, if you’re trading longer-term, you should always have a stop-loss in place for every trade. Unless you’re superhuman, it’s impossible to monitor the markets at all times, 24/7.</p>
								<p>A stop-loss will mean that even if the markets perform unexpectedly, you won’t be stuck in a losing position while you’re asleep. Top futures traders always keep an eye on the big picture and stay abreast of the news, however. Make sure you hone your analytical skills, learn to read charts and use technical tools. If you incorporate all this into your trading plan, you’ll start to see more good days than bad ones.</p>
								<p>Only DGTX holders will be able to trade on the Digitex Futures exchange, as all trades will be denominated in DGTX tokens. You can buy tokens from one of our exchange partners, or via the Digitex Treasury. Buying from the Treasury is trustless and instant, meaning there’s no price slippage.</p>

								<h3>The Digitex (DGTX) Token</h3>
								<h4>The DGTX Token: Native Currency of the Digitex Futures Exchange</h4>
								<p>The <b>DGTX token</b> is the native currency and lifeblood of the Digitex Futures exchange. It’s a utility token and the sole passport to the exchange. Anyone who wants to participate in our commission-free markets using non-custodial accounts must own DGTX tokens. All trades on the exchange are settled in DGTX, and all account balances are denominated in DGTX.</p>
								<p>Because Digitex is the only futures exchange offering commission-free trading (which has huge advantages for regular and particularly short-term traders), the exchange’s reliance on the DGTX token will create a demand for it among traders.</p>
								<p>The laws of supply and demand will ensure that DGTX holds its value. The demand for the token, plus its utility on the Digitex exchange, will work together to <b>ensure the liquidity</b> of both the token and the exchange itself.</p>
								<h4>Buying DGTX</h4>
								<p>For your convenience, there are several methods available for buying DGTX tokens. Here, we outline each one:</p>
								<h4>Exchanges:</h4>
								<p>You can buy DGTX on our exchange partners HitBTC, Mercatox, Stex or CoinExchange.io. All you need to do is create an account, buy some ETH or BTC, and then convert it to DGTX. On HitBTC, you can also buy DGTX with USDT.</p>
								<h4>Changelley Instant Exchange:</h4>
								<p>Changelly allows you to convert any digital coin for DGTX quickly using only an email address to create an account. All you need is an ERC20-compatible wallet address to send your DGTX to (such as MyEtherWallet) and the address that you have your ETH, BTC, or any other digital asset stored.</p>
								<h4>Digitex Treasury:</h4>
								<p>Avoid creating an account at an exchange and get a trustless, secure and instant transaction by buying DGTX through our <b>Digitex Treasury</b>. This is an ongoing token sale over the next 2.5 years serving to finance the development and operation of the exchange while providing token-holders with an easy secure purchase for a minimal market premium.</p>
								<p>There are plenty of ways to buy DGTX and we will be adding more in the future, so it depends on the method that suits you and the amount you want to buy. Please feel free to contact us if you need any assistance in this matter. The Digitex Treasury cannot sell any tokens to US residents or citizens.</p>
								<h4>DGTX Token Supply and Distribution</h4>
								<p>The total supply of DGTX is 1,000,000,000 (one billion) DGTX tokens which is distributed as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>70% public</li>
									<li>10% insurance fund</li>
									<li>10% treasury</li>
									<li>10% team</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Continued Funding</h4>
								<p>There are three phases of revenue generation for the Digitex Futures exchange. The first was our ICO token sale on 15th January, 2018 which raised over $5m. The second and current phase is the Digitex Treasury token sale which will last until the end of 2021. The third phase is Digitex Token Issuance, which starts in 2022.</p>
								<h4>DGTX Token Price Performance Since ICO</h4>
								<p>The <b>DGTX token</b> has had three major peaks during its lifetime so far. The most significant came at the height of the crypto winter, during the second half of 2018 when Bitcoin and other cryptos were mostly falling. DGTX bucked the market trend, rising from $0.007 on 1st August to a peak of $0.16 by mid-October.</p>
								<p>Of course, the cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile so it’s impossible to maintain a single price point for a coin subject to supply and demand. In the 12 months between July 2018 and July 2019, DGTX had 10x’d its value. Not many projects can boast these kinds of positive price movements.</p>
								<p>Once the <b>exchange</b> goes live, we anticipate that demand for DGTX will increase substantially further as traders decide to migrate to Digitex for the benefits of commission-free trading and non-custodial accounts.</p>

							<div data-id="cb5" class="cb-item">
								<h3>The Digitex Treasury Token Sale</h3>
								<h4>The Digitex Treasury: An Ongoing Token Sale That Funds Exchange Operations</h4>
								<p>In order to secure continued funding for the Digitex Futures exchange the Digitex Treasury was created. The Treasury is an ongoing token sale in which buyers can purchase directly from Digitex with zero slippage in an instant trustless transaction.</p>
								<p>The Digitex Treasury allows traders to buy DGTX easily and instantly without having to go through an exchange. At the same time, it funds our operations and continued marketing and development costs.</p>
								<p>Note that Digitex has three phases of revenue generation. The first was the ICO in January 2018, which raised over $5 million. The Treasury is the second and current phase and will last until 2021, and the final phase is token issuance, which will likely begin from 2022 onward.</p>
								<h4>How To Buy DGTX Tokens From The Digitex Treasury</h4>
								<p>You can buy DGTX tokens from the Digitex Treasury easily. Simply create an account and verify your identity by completing some basic KYC. Send ETH from your Ethereum wallet to our token sale smart contract address. As soon as we receive your payment, the smart contract will automatically calculate the number of DGTX tokens and send them back to the same Ethereum wallet address. The transaction is instant and trustless.</p>
								<p>Please note, your Ethereum wallet must be compatible with DGTX tokens. Never send ether from a cryptocurrency exchange wallet or another provider that does not accept DGTX or your tokens will be lost.</p>
								<h4>Digitex Treasury KYC Requirements </h4>
								<p>In order to purchase tokens via the Digitex Treasury token sale, you must first pass Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. This information is used specifically for the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other financial crimes and to ensure you are not attempting to buy DGTX tokens from a restricted Jurisdiction.</p>
								<p>To buy DGTX tokens you must be at least 18 years of age. Purchasers that are residents or citizens of the United States of America or any of its insular areas, or Iran, Israel, North Korea, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Syria or the Vatican are ineligible to buy tokens through the Digitex Treasury.</p>
								<p>You will be required to submit your Email address, First and Last names, Date of Birth, Phone Number and Address. You will be required to submit a photo of a government-issued ID. This can be a passport, driver's licence or ID card. All corners of the document must be visible and the text in the document should be easy to read. The Document you submit must be valid for at least 1 month, otherwise, it will be rejected by the system.</p>
								<p>You will then be required to upload a selfie of yourself holding the Document used in the previous step. Your face should be visible both on the selfie and on the photo in the document. The text on the document must also be readable if it is unreadable due to poor image quality or glare it will be rejected. After your Document and Selfie is approved you are free to buy DGTX tokens. </p>
								<p>Should you require any assistance with any of the steps above, please write to us at
									<a href="mailto:support@digitexfutures.com">support@digitexfutures.com</a>. Please note that we will never ask you to send us funds directly and all purchases must go through the Treasury Smart Contract (<span class="red">0x9C666C69595c278063278a604FF12c70691AB234</span>)</p>

								<h3>How Digitex Makes Money</h3>
								<h4>The Digitex ICO - January 2018</h4>
								<p>The Digitex ICO was conducted on 15th January 2018. 650,000,000 DGTX tokens were sold to the public inside 17 minutes at a price of $0.01 per token, along with a 20% first week bonus. $5.4million was raised from 2530 buyers.</p>
								<h4>The Whale Sale - February 2018</h4>
								<p>The Digitex Whale Sale was conducted on 15th February 2018. 100,000,000 DGTX tokens were offered to the public in a reverse auction format. After 24 hours the sale concluded at a price of $0.0197 per token. $1.97million was raised from 3,355 buyers.</p>
								<h4>The Digitex Treasury Token Sale - Ongoing</h4>
								<p>The second means of funding operations is our ongoing token sale, the Digitex Treasury. The Treasury is a smart contract that holds 100 million DGTX tokens which are released in 10 quarterly token sales, every three months over the next 2.5 years. The first sale opened on 1st March 2019, and the last one will open on 1st June 2021. Buyers can enjoy zero slippage and an instant trustless transaction while helping to fund commission free trading.</p>
								<h4>Token Issuance - Starting in 2022 </h4>

							<div data-id="cb7" class="cb-item">
								<h3>Perpetual Swap Futures Contracts</h3>
								<h4>The Mechanics of Perpetual Swap Futures</h4>
								<p>Perpetual contracts are a special kind of futures contract with no expiry or settlement.</p>
								<p>Perpetual Contracts mimic a margin-based spot market and thus trade close to the underlying reference Index Price. This is in contrast to a futures contract with an expiry date (e.g. a monthly or quarterly contract) which may trade at significantly different prices while the expiry date remains a period of time away. The primary mechanism that keeps a perpetual contract trading close to the underlying spot price is Funding.</p>
								<p>Each contract on our perpetual contract offerings is $1. This means that to purchase 1 contract without any leverage you would need $1 worth of DGTX tokens, at 100x leverage you would only require $0.01 worth of DGTX per contract.</p>

								<p>Bitcoin is currently trading at $10,000. Gary wants to trade the equivalent of 1BTC on the Digitex Futures BTC/USD Perpetual Contract market. As 1 contract is the equivalent of $1, at no leverage he would require $10,000 worth of DGTX as his initial margin to buy 10,000 contracts. After buying 10,000 contracts at $10,000, Bitcoin quickly moves to $10,100. Gary decides to sell 10,000 contracts at $10,100. As there are zero trading fees, Gary’s profit is $100 worth of DGTX tokens.</p>
								<h4>Funding</h4>
								<p>Funding is the key mechanism by which the price of a perpetual contract remains as close as possible to the spot price of the underlying asset. </p>
								<p>Digitex Futures does not receive any of the fees paid on funding; it is exchanged directly peer-to-peer between holders of long and short positions. </p>
								<p>The <b class="black">Funding rate</b> consists of: <b class="black">Interest Rate & Premium Index</b>:</p>
                                <h4>Interest Rate</h4>
                                <p>Each Perpetual contract traded on the Digitex Futures Exchange consists of a Base currency, e.g. BTC, and a Quote currency, e.g. USD. The Interest Rate is a function of the interest rate between these two currencies. For the BTCUSD perpetual, it is the difference between the borrowing costs of BTC and USD.</p>

                                <h4>Funding Rate Calculation</h4>
                                <p>Digitex calculates the Premium Index (P) and Interest Rate (I) every 60 seconds and subsequently performs an 8-Hour Time Weighted Average Price over a series of minute rates.</p>
                                <p>The Funding Rate is then calculated with the 8-Hour Interest Rate Component and the 8-Hour Premium/Discount Component. A plus or minus 0.05% dampener is also added.</p>
                                <p>Funding Rate (F) = Premium Index (P) + clamp(Interest Rate (I) - Premium Index (P), 0.05%, -0.05%)</p>
                                <p>Therefore, if (I - P) is within +/-0.05% then F = P + (I - P) = I. In simple terms, the Funding Rate will equal the Interest Rate.</p>
                                <p>This calculated Funding Rate is then applied to a trader’s Position Value to determine the Funding Amount to be received or paid at the time that funding occurs.</p>
                                <h4>Dual-Price Mechanism</h4>
                                <p>Digitex uses a Dual-Price Mechanism to ensure users do not fall victim to blatant market manipulation. Market manipulation can cause the futures price of the underlying to deviate significantly from the spot price, causing a huge number of liquidations to occur.</p>
                                <p>Mark Price is used as a trigger for liquidations. Mark Price is the spot index price plus a decaying funding basis rate.</p>
                                <h4>Calculation of Mark Price</h4>
                                <p><b class="black">Mark Price (the price at which Liquidations occur)</b> = Index Price x (1+ Funding Basis)</p>

                                <h4>What is Margin and Leverage?</h4>
                                <p>Margin is the amount required in order to enter a position.</p>
                                <p>With leverage, traders are able to open a position by using only a fraction of the margin that they would otherwise need without leverage. The higher leverage amount a trader uses the lower the margin requirements.</p>
                                <h4>How is Margin Calculated?</h4>
                                <p>Margin requirements differ for each market traded on and the amount of leverage used. On the BTC/USD perpetual market, the initial margin for a position is 1%. This means that the minimum required margin needed to open a position is 1% (at 100x leverage).</p>

                                <h3>Insurance Fund</h3>
                                <h4>The Digitex Insurance Fund: Ensuring Stability and Liquidity on the Digitex Futures Markets</h4>
                                <p>The Liquidation Engine of the Digitex Futures exchange takes over and liquidates the positions of traders whose account balances have dropped below the required Maintenance Margin amount needed to maintain their open position. Any funds made from this by the exchange are allocated to the Insurance Fund.</p>
                                <p>The exchange stops out the trader at the bankruptcy price as if he or she lost the entire Initial Margin posted to open the position. This way, it is possible that the exchange obtains a better price. All additional funds made in this situation are deposited into our Insurance Fund. Any losses suffered by the exchange when a trader loses more than their account balance are covered by the same Insurance Fund. This ensures stability and liquidity on the Digitex Futures markets.</p>
                                <p>The profits made by the Liquidation Engine for the Insurance Fund typically come from high risk, highly leveraged traders who accept that forcing the exchange to take over their position may result in bigger losses than if they managed their position more responsibly. Therefore, it is very possible for traders to avoid any contact with the Liquidation Engine if they wish.</p>
                                <p>This system is very similar to how BitMEX takes over and liquidates bankrupt traders’ positions. The BitMEX Insurance Fund balance increases with virtually no daily drawdowns of any significance over a period of years, even during periods of high volatility.</p>
                                <p>The BitMEX Insurance Fund balance has increased 99 days out of the last 100 days and this is typical performance going back for years.</p>
                                <h4>How Is the Insurance Fund Funded?</h4>
                                <p>Traders on the Digitex Futures exchange must have sufficient Initial Margin in their trading account to open a futures position. After opening a futures position, a trader must have sufficient Maintenance Margin in their trading account to keep that position open.</p>
                                <p>The Maintenance Margin required to maintain an open position is 50% of the Initial Margin the trader posted to open that position. If the trader’s account balance falls below the Maintenance Margin requirement to maintain the current open position, the system will cancel the unmatched orders on that market to free up the margin requirements of those unmatched orders.</p>
                                <p>If after doing this, the account balance is still below the required Maintenance Margin, the system will take over the trader’s position and liquidate it.</p>
                                <p>After assuming a trader’s open futures position, the system will attempt to immediately close that position by submitting a buy or sell order at the bankruptcy price. The bankruptcy price is the price at which the trader will lose the entire Initial Margin amount posted to open the position.</p>
                                <p>For Long positions, the bankruptcy price is calculated by subtracting the Initial Margin requirement from the trader’s entry price. For Short positions, the bankruptcy price is calculated by adding the Initial Margin requirement to the trader’s entry price.</p>
                                <p>After assuming a trader’s position, if the system is able to liquidate that position at a better price than bankruptcy price, the additional funds are placed into the Insurance Fund.</p>
                                <p>Example trade: Bob places a limit order to buy 1 BTC/USD futures contract at 10,000 at 100x leverage which requires Initial Margin of 100 DGTX. He has exactly 100 DGTX in his trading account and shortly after placing it, his buy order is filled. His Maintenance Margin requirement is therefore 50 DGTX, which means his account balance must have at least 50 DGTX in it to maintain this open Long position. If the price drops below 9,950, his account balance falls below 50 DGTX and the system will take over his position and submit a sell order at the bankruptcy price of 9,900 (Entry Price – Initial Margin).</p>
                                <p>In the above example, if the system submits a sell order at 9,900 when the last traded price is currently 9,950, it is possible that the position will be closed at a better price than 9,900. If the position is liquidated at 9,940, then 40 DGTX will be added to the Insurance Fund.</p>
                                <p>This effectively means that traders who allow their position to be force liquidated by the exchange by allowing their account balance to go below the required Maintenance Margin level will always lose the full Initial Margin amount they posted to open that position, even if the position is closed at a better price than bankruptcy price. Any additional funds that are made by getting a better price than bankruptcy price are added to the Insurance Fund and not to the trader’s account. This will incentivize traders to avoid forced liquidations which are a risk vector for the exchange.</p>
                                <p>The profits made by the Liquidation Engine typically come from high risk, highly leveraged traders who accept that forcing the exchange to take over their position may result in bigger losses than if they managed their position more responsibly.</p>

                                <h4>Market Orders</h4>
                                <p>A market order is an order which allows a trader to buy or sell at the current best available price. Usually, this type of order will be executed immediately. However, the price at which a market order is executed is not guaranteed. </p>
                                <p>It is important to remember that the last traded price is not always the price at which a market order will be executed. In quick-moving markets, the price at which a market order will execute often deviates from the last-traded price or real-time price quote.</p>
                                <h4>Limit Orders</h4>
                                <p>A limit order is an order to buy or sell at a specific price or better. A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower, and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher.</p>
                                <p>This ensures that a trader will never pay more than what he or she has bid, although a limit order is not guaranteed to execute. A limit order can only be filled if the market price reaches the limit price.</p>
                                <h4>Stop Orders</h4>
                                <p>A stop order is an order to buy or sell an asset when its price moves beyond or below a particular price. Once the market price passes the predefined entry or exit point, the stop order becomes a market order.</p>
                                <h4>Stop Limit Orders</h4>
                                <p>A stop limit order is a conditional type of order that combines a stop order and a limit order. Once an asset reaches the stop price, a limit order is automatically triggered to buy/sell at a specific target price. However, as with a limit order, it is not guaranteed to execute.</p>

                                <h3>The Digitex Waitlist</h3>
                                <h4>What is the Digitex Waitlist?</h4>
                                <p>The Digitex waitlist demonstrates the massive demand for commission-free trading. It is currently closed and has over 1.5 million traders signed up waiting for the exchange to launch. As well as participating in a waitlist competition winning free DGTX by referring friends, those who have signed up can receive the latest updates and news about the project.</p>
                                <p>How did we accumulate such a massive number of people so quickly? Well, commission-free trading is a massive pull in itself. Add to that additional futures markets other than Bitcoin, non-custodial account balances, and an intuitive one-click ladder trading interface that allows traders to stay in the zone, and we have a winning combination!</p>
                                <p>We also applied a hefty dose of viral marketing and leveraged the power of the Digitex community to ensure that the message got out. We used a referral system to incentivize people to spread the word about Digitex and get more and more to sign up.</p>
                                <p>Those who referred the most battled out for 10 top prizes of 100K DGTX each. On top of that, the top 10,000 names have been confirmed and will each be airdropped 1000 DGTX upon launch of the exchange.</p>
                                <p>We know that our unique value propositions already sell themselves, but with skilled referral marketing, we were able to exceed even our own expectations.</p>
                                <h4>What Is Waitlist Three? (September 2019 - November 2019)</h4>
                                <p>The third and final waitlist takes on a different twist. With a set date for the public testnet on 30 November, we’re once again giving people the chance to win free DGTX. In the same vein as the last two campaigns, it’s all about spreading the word about Digitex to as many traders as possible.</p>
                                <p>All you need to do is <b>join the waitlist</b> and start sharing your unique link. The more people you refer, the higher up the list you go. This time around, however, we’ve split it into five localized campaigns. So you can choose the one that suits you best according to your language and region.</p>
                                <p>Join the <b>South Korean</b> / <b>Japanese</b> / <b>Chinese</b> / <b>Russian</b> / or <b>English</b> Digitex Waitlists and start sharing your unique referral link.</p>
                                <p>The top 10 names on each list will each win 50,000 DGTX each. And the top 500 names on the waitlist will get 1,000 DGTX each airdropped into their accounts and ready to trade once the exchange testnet goes live.</p>
                                <p>All winners will be announced upon completion of the waitlist.</p>

                                <h3>Affiliate Program</h3>
                                <p>To incentivize as many people as possible to join the Digitex Futures revolution, we’ve also launched our very first affiliate program! The affiliate program is designed to drive token sales to the Digitex Treasury.</p>
                                <p>Simply use the same unique link that you receive when you sign up to our waitlist.

And if any of your friends then refer their friends to buy DGTX from the Digitex Treasury, we’ll give you 5% of those sales too.</p>
                                <p>It’s really easy to track your sales and get paid. Simply <b>create an account on our affiliate portal</b> using the same email that you signed up to the waitlist and you’ll be able to track your sales. We payout your rewards in ETH on a daily basis.</p>
